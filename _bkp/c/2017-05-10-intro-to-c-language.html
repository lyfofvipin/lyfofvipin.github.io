<p>In this blog we will be covering </p>
<p>Let us start with it.</p>
<p>First of all, I will tell you that C is a high-level language, which developed by Dennis Ritchie, in 1972, in AT and T's bell laboratory California</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the levels of language</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LOW-LEVEL </strong></li>
<li><strong>HIGH-LEVEL</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Low-Level languages</h3>
<p>To code in a low-level language, we need a good knowledge of binaries and how we can directly interact with hardware. Without knowledge of binaries and hardware, we couldn't use a low-level language.</p>
<h3>High-level languages</h3>
<p>High-level languages are those languages which do not depend on any assembly language knowledge or we can say that a user does not need any knowledge of hardware connectivity via languages because a high-level language is developed that any user can use that without any deep knowledge of assembly language or can directly start writing code without much knowledge of drivers and all.</p>
<p>That's the different thing that a low-level language is easily understood by computer or we can say the machine but a high-level language is easily understood by us that is why all the languages which are considered in programming are high-level.</p>
<p>Now let's dig into a bit with C.<br />
So in any language, We have fix words that represent something or we can say are already booked these words are known as <strong>KeyWords</strong> similarly we have 32 keywords in C or we call them reserved words.</p>
<h5>Here is the list of Keywords in C</h5>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Auto</td>
<td>double</td>
<td>int</td>
<td>struct</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>break</td>
<td>else</td>
<td>long</td>
<td>switch</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>case</td>
<td>enum</td>
<td>register</td>
<td>typedef</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>char</td>
<td>xtern</td>
<td>return</td>
<td>union</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>const</td>
<td>float</td>
<td>short</td>
<td>unsigned</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>continue</td>
<td>for</td>
<td>signed</td>
<td>void</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>default</td>
<td>goto</td>
<td>sizeof</td>
<td>volatile</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>do</td>
<td>if</td>
<td>static</td>
<td>while</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So now let's see what kind of character C support or we can say what kind of symbols and letters we can use in writing expressions.<br />
<code>We can use any alphabets A,B,C ......Z or a, b, c........z</code><br />
<code>We can use Digits  .....-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2-1,0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9,......</code><br />
and <code>Symbols  ! @ # % ^ &amp; * () _ + - = ; : ' " .......</code><br />
NOTE:-&gt;</p>
<p>We can use any kind of symbol in C language except  Dollar sign ($) this sign is not supported in any expression or in any statement in C language.</p>
<h4>Environment to write Code:-</h4>
<p>So to run a C program you need to have GCC in your system and I would suggest you use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as your text editor and run your code in via Command line. And if you got mess up with setting it in windows then you can use <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code Block</a>.</p>
<p>and in Linux we use command</p>
<pre>gcc name_of_program.c</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>cc name_of_programc.c</pre>
<p>To compile the code<br />
and command</p>
<pre>./a.out</pre>
<p>to saw the Output of the program.</p>
