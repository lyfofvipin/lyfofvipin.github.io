I will remamber you about ternary operator or conditional operator.
I keept it to disscus latter while we learning operator
it's right time to learn it.
Well now we all have a good knowledge of If-Else,
statement now you can easely learn ternary operator (conditional operator).

syntex :

condiction ? expression_1 : expression_2 ;

&nbsp;

It check the condiction and if it is true then expression_1 will run
and if condiction will not true then expression_2 will run.
