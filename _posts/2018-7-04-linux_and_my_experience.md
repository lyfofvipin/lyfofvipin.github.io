Well, I start using Linux since last 2 years and i became hooked,
I haven't try too many Linux distros But I like Fedora,
Many things have drawn me to Linux.
I am constantly amazed at the large selection of high quality distros available to people for free.
And I found stability and security which is on-par or even superior to that of Mac OS X.
It is fun to became the super-user, It's like having power to do anything,

It provide a lots of useful tools like LibreOffice Draw, LibreOffice Impress, LibreOffice Writer,
Boxes, Maps, Software, Calculator, Calendar, Cheese etc. inbuilt to make your work easier.

As a result of using Linux, I have become an open source software enthusiast,
who admires the work of true (beneficial) hackers.
Probably to most people, the term “hacker” has negative connotations,
which is largely the result of the misuse of this term. A “true” hacker is not someone who tries to break in to other people’s computers,
and steal things or commit other criminal acts. Instead, true hackers work to do good things with their talents,
such as to create and improve open source software,
like Linux for example. In short, true hackers build rather than destroy and give rather than steal.

Hope you will start using Linux as soon as possible. ;)
