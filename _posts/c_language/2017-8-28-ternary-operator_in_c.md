I will remember you about ternary operator or conditional operator.
I kept it to discus latter while we learning operator
it's right time to learn it.
Well now we all have a good knowledge of If-Else,
statement now you can easely learn ternary operator (conditional operator).

syntex :

`condition ? expression_1 : expression_2 ;`


It check the condiction and if it is true then expression_1 will run
and if condiction will not true then expression_2 will run.
