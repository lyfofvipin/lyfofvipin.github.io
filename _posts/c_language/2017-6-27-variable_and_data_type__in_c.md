A data type is nothing it is just a type of data like if integer character decimal number and Many other kind of data.

## Let us discuss different type of data types

PRIMARY DATA TYPE

SECONDARY DATA TYPE

### PRIMARY DATA TYPE

#### Integer

It is Kind of data type which tell that a integer is being used in a program
in easy language we can say that a number is use in our program.

#### Character data type

It is a kind of data type which tell that a character
even that is symbol for a letter or an alphabet is used in our program.

#### Double data type

This data type tell us that a decimal number is being used a program for printing for taking a decimal number from user
the same work is being done by float data type but
float data type round off our number and double data type does not round orf number.

#### Float data type

It is also act as double data type it also tell that it is a molecule your program
but it round off that decimal number.

### SECONDARY DATA TYPE

This data type use while we learn modular programing
in c they form using primary data types.
