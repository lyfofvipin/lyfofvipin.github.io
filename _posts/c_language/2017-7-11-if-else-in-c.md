# If Else In C

In C programming, the `if-else` statement is used to make decisions in the code. It allows you to execute a block of code based on whether a condition is `true` or `false`.

Syntax:

```
if ( condition ) {

    // Code to execute if the condition is true

}

else {

    // Code to execute if the condition is false

}
```

`condition`: This is an expression that evaluates to either true (non-zero) or false (zero).

`if` block: This block of code runs if the condition is true.

Syntax:
```
if ( condition ) {

    // Code to execute if the condition is true

}
```

`else` block: This block of code runs if the condition is false.

## How it works:
The condition is evaluated.

If the condition is true (non-zero), the code inside the if block is executed.

If the condition is false (zero), the code inside the else block is executed.


* We can use only `if` statements without an `else` statement.

* But We can not use only `else` statements without an `if` statement.
