# Using operator

```
#include<stdio.h>;
#include<conio.h>;
void main()
{
    int a,b,sum;
    printf("enter first number");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("enter secand number");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    sum=a+b;
    printf("the sum is %d",sum);
    getch();
}
```

Hear we used `+` operator between two variable a and b in sum.
the name of all the variable are given by us you can give any other names to the variable.
