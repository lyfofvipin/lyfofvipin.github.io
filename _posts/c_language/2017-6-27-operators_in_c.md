# And now we will discuss about operators in C.

## Generally we have three types of operator

1 Unary operator

2 Binary operator

3 Ternary operator or conditional operator

### Unary operator

Unary operators are used only single operands

For example (), [] , {} etc.


### Binary operator

Binary operator need two operands
For example addition ,subtraction, multiplication etc.

### Ternary operator

This operator need three operands to work one is condiction
and two are expresion. We will deeply study while we make some programs on it.


### Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators are you to perform any mathematical operation

Like

`+` adding

`-` subtracting

`*` multiply

`/` divide

`%` finding remainder.{10%3=1(remainder)}

there all are arithmetic operator type of binary operater.


### Relational operators

From it's come in the name of operator this operator show any
relation between two operands.

`<` less then

`>` greater then

`==` equal to

`<=` less than equal to

`>=` greater than equal to

`!=` no equal to

They are also binary operator

### Logical operator

We have three kind of logical operator in C.

`&` and operator

`||` or operator

`!` not operater

### Sizeof() operator

This operator tell us the size of a data type.
We will discuss it later while we may program on operator.
