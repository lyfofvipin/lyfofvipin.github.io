#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
void main()
{
char test;
printf("Enter a character :");
scanf("%c",&amp;test);
printf("The ASCII value of %c is = %d :",test,test);
}

OUTPUT :
1.

Enter a character :x
The ASCII value of x is = 120 :

2.

Enter a character :%
The ASCII value of % is = 37 :

In this code we take a char and print that using %d,
it will not change value of test.
