And now we will discuss about operators in C.

&nbsp;

Generally we have three types of operator=====&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&nbsp;

1 Unary operator

&nbsp;

2 Binary operator

&nbsp;

3 Ternary operator or conditional operator

&nbsp;

Unary operator -----&gt;

Unary operators are used only single operands

For example (), [] , {} etc.

&nbsp;

Binary operator----&gt;

Binary operator need two operands

For example addition ,subtraction, multiplication etc.

&nbsp;

Ternary operator---&gt;

This operator need three operands to work one is condiction

and two are expresion. We will deeply study while we make some programs

on it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Arithmetic operaters---&gt;

Arithmetic operators are you to perform any mathematical operation

Like

+ adding

- subtracting

* multiply

/ divide

% finding remainder.{10%3=1(remainder)}

ther all are arthmatic operater type of binary operater.

&nbsp;

Relational operators===&gt;&gt;

From it's come in the name of operator this operator show any

relation between two operands.

&lt; less then

&gt; greater then

== equal to

&lt;= less than equal to

&gt;= greater than equal to

!= no equal to

&nbsp;

They are also binary operator

&nbsp;

Logical operator=====&gt;

We have three kind of logical operator in C.

A &amp;&amp; and operator

B || or operator

C ! not operater

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sizeof() operator =====&gt;

This operator tell us the size of a data type.

We will discuss it later while we may program on operator.
