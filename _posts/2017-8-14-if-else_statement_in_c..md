Friends now we are Going To start If-Else.
Some time we have to make some decision in our program for those we have If statement.
If statement work in such a way

1.

if (condition)
statement;

if our condition is true then our statement will run

2.

if (condition)
statement_1;
else
statement_2;

In this case if our condition is true then our statement_1 will run and
if our condition is false then our statement_2 will run.

3.

if (condition)
{
statement_1;
statement_2;
statement_.....;
}
else
statement_n;

In this case if our condition is true then all our statements written in if
( or we can say all statement in that pair of {} ) will run .

NOTE : -&gt; If we have more than one statement than pair of {} is necessary.

If our condition is false then our statement_n will run. which was written in
else.

3.

if (condition)
{
statement_1;
statement_2;
statement_.....;
}
else
{
statement_1;
statement_2;
statement_.....;
}
In this case if our condition is true then all our statements written in if
( or we can say all statement in that pair of {} after if ) will run .

If our condition is false then our all statements written in else will run.
which was written in else.
( or we can say all statement in that pair of {} after else ) will run .

NOTE : -&gt; If we have more than one statement than pair of {} is necessary.

In our next PostÂ  we will code some programe. Based on If-else statements

and do some example.
