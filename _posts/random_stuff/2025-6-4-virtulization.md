### Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something such as a computer system, server. Instead of using physical hardware for each system or resource, virtualization allows multiple systems or functions to run on a single physical machine.

## Hypervisor
A hypervisor (sometimes called a virtual machine monitor, or VMM) is software that creates, runs, and manages virtual machines (VMs) on a physical computer. It acts as a middle layer between the hardware and the operating systems running in the VMs.
